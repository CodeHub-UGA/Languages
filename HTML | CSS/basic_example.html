             "Hello       World!" would actually be rendered as "Hello World!". This is 
             why spacing in HTML, such as indentation, does not matter, and the content 
             can be spaced out according to the developer's liking. To ensure spaces do 
             not condense together, either  &nbsp or a non- breaking spaces must be used. -->
