# About
Founded in 1991 by developer Guido Van Rossum, [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose dynamic programming language that focuses on code readability. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. Look at the table of contents for [The Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/2/library/index.html#library-index) to get an idea of what’s available. 

Python programs generally are smaller than other programming languages like Java. Programmers have to type relatively less and indentation requirement of the language, makes them readable all the time. Furthermore, Python programs are easy to debug which encourages rapid development of application prototypes, marking itself as the language to code with. 

<br>

Due to these aspects, Python is a high demand language. Python climbed from third place to tie for second in the latest ranking of programming language popularity. It’s the first time that a language other than JavaScript, which remains number one, or Java, the other runner-up, has entered the top two.

# Examples of Python uses:
Python supports cross-platform operating systems which makes building applications with it all the more convenient. The biggest strength of Python is huge collection of standard library which can be used for the following:

- Machine Learning
- GUI Applications (like Kivy, Tkinter, PyQt etc. )
- Web frameworks like Django (used by YouTube, Instagram, Dropbox)
- Image processing (like OpenCV, Pillow)
- Web scraping (like Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium)
- Test frameworks
- Multimedia
- Scientific computing
- Text processing and many more..
