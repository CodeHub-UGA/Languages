# HTML & CSS

HTML and CSS stand for HyperText Markup Language and Cascading Style Sheets, respectively. They, collectively, are the cornerstone of the internet, and it is absolutely critical that aspiring web developers learn them.

Generally speaking, HTML & CSS are not considered programming languages, as they are not individually Turing Complete. However, when used together, they have been proven to be Turing Complete. Furthermore, the "M" in HTML stands for Markup; in other words, HTML is a text-processing language, and CSS is the accompanying stylesheet. 

The current standards for HTML and CSS are HTML5 and CSS3, respectively. However, due to the large number of modern browsers, HTML and CSS implementations may vary from browser to browser, and so it is up to the developer to ensure browser/device cross-compadability. Most of these inconsistencies arise from syling issues; and can generally be fixed by using a CSS reset script ([Eric Meyer's "Reset CSS"][reset-css] has been uploaded to this drive).
